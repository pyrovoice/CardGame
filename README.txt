Card idea:
	
- High power, but silence everything else you own at that location
- Stone giant: harmless, high defense, raise limit to conquer OR block additional creatures if it can survive

Archetypes:
- master of the wild Hunt: Boss monster followed by Wolves. Generates wolves, send them to attack creatures, stay alive while it has wolves
- Rabbits: generate tokens, boost all tokens
- Fishes: Effects to sacrifice your small fishes to summon random bigger fishes
- Faction with Negative effects on their monsters and a bunch of silence/Effect cancel
- Dwarf faction mining for gold and getting stronger the more gold they have
- Geomancer that vastly modify battlefields
- Circus act: alternate between balls, diabolo and something else. have a number of item set or flying, with cards setting or using flying items for effects depending on the type of Act, and cards to switch between acts. act difficulty?

Game principles:

Gold: Gained each turn, starts at 3/turn, can grind up ?
Cards: Gained each turn, starts at 2/turn, can grind up?
Gold/Cards: Or, get 3 cards per turn, can pitch 2 per turn to get 2 then 1 gold.
Charges: Get charges on common game event (everytime a non-token creature dies?)
Archetypre/elemental charges: Gained by common game event of the specific type
Fight: Each location has 6 slots for creatures on 3 lanes. Creatures always fill lanes from left to right and fight in their own lane. Each lane has a front row and a back row, with creatures attacking the front row first if possible.
Player needs to places creatures on filled row before they can player creatures on free rows. Any row unprotected will have the creature attack the location directly. Dealing enough damage at a location will either damage it or capture it. Damaging grant a small reward and lower the requirement to capture, capturing grants a point and/or a special resource?
Scoring: When the player scores, the opponent becomes stronger. When the opponent scores, the player lose a life (they start with low amount of life, but are giving shields every match) and gain some resources.
Boss Deck: Contains Boss creatures that serve either as Boss and have strict requirements, or as Sideboard cards and have less strict requirements but cost more resources
Locations: Up to three, they have a capture threshold, an effect and a reward. lose to many and los ethe game, win by capture enough/resisting waves for a number of turn
Hero power: Each hero has several shared power + an archetype power

Ideas to justify pull and push: 
- Locations have a crystal that can be corrupted or fred, the player adds "good" resource while the opponent add "corruption" to it. Possible ressource: Vitality, to restore the crystal. Purification. 

Questions:
- How much can a player prepare before starting scoring? What are ways to prevent the player from just farming resources before winning in one swoop?
