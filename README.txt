Card idea:
	
High power, but silence everything else you own at that location

Archetypes:
- master of the wild Hunt: Boss monster followed by Wolves. Generates wolves, send them to attack creatures, stay alive while it has wolves
- Rabbits: generate tokens, boost all tokens
- Fishes: Effects to sacrifice your small fishes to summon random bigger fishes
- Faction with Negative effects on their monsters and a bunch of silence/Effect cancel

Game principles:

Gold: Gained each turn, starts at 3/turn, can grind up ?
Cards: Gained each turn, starts at 2/turn, can grind up?
Gold/Cards: Or, get 3 cards per turn, can pitch 2 per turn to get 2 then 1 gold.
Charges: Get charges on common game event (everytime a non-token creature dies?)
Archetypre/elemental charges: Gained by common game event of the specific type
Fight: Before scoring, both side fight killing strongest creatures before smallests (or player can order creatures?). Then try to capture location. Any location not capture becomes damaged and easier to capture.
Boss Deck: Contains Boss creatures that serve either as Boss and have strict requirements, or as Sideboard cards and have less strict requirements but cost more resources
Locations: Up to three, they have a capture threshold, an effect and a reward. lose to many and los ethe game, win by capture enough/resisting waves for a number of turn
Hero power: Each hero has several shared power + an archetype power
