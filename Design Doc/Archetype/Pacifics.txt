Archetype: Control
Gimmicks: Creatures do not deal damage, instead creating nightmare in the opponent's deck and making them mill. 
Can target specific cards to be destroyed (but not the specific instance of the card) and manipulate the opposing's deck that way


Nightmare creatures are then played for free when a card is milled with a nightmare on it

Boss: - The opponent must have an empty card pool. On play, lock that card pool (it does not replenish)
