Gimmick: After fighting or other conditions, raise the cost of the card by +1 then +3. Other cards can use this to improve their effects

Cards:
- Discard and sacrifice monsters in play: Steal opponent card with cost lower than sacced monster's cost
- Sacrifice a monster: Draw cards equal to the cost of the sacced monster
- Raise or Lower card's cost + charges
- X cost, X equal target: Steal it/ destroy it
- Steal target creature for the turn. If cost <= X, steal it instead.

Extra:
- Sacrifice any number and at least one of this archetype: Summoned boss has Might equal to the total cost of sacced monsters


Idea: Use a silver then golden outline for level 1 and 2, maybe use Sphere mask transition there?
